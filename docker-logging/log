# the ImageName must be last - because it contains dots.
# image id does not (hopefully). this way we can "re-connect
# the dots" and get back the full image name, including host
# name part at the end.

# the image "me.with.dots/busy/box:boo" is a simple busybox,
# just tagged differently. I want to have the image name 
# available in elastic, so I needed to test whether this is
# actually possible.
