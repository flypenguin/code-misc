# code-misc

This repository contains code & stuff about things ...

- ... I found useful
- ... I experimented with
- ... I want to remember for later

Everything is **small**, cause otherwise it would have its own repo ;) .

The directories are:


- [**blog/**](blog/) - stuff I wrote for a [blog post](https://www.flypenguin.de)
- [**experiments/**](experiments/) - mostly me answering "how does this behave _exactly_?" for small questions
- [**snippets/**](snippets/) - single-file things I thought I could need later
- [**templates/**](templates/) - well, templates.
- [**tools/**](tools/) - basically the same as snippets, just not single files but "tinymini projects"
