sublime-piper
=============

Sublime Text plugin -- pipe buffers through external commands (like ViM's `!` command, for example).

`CMD-SHIFT-1` will (Linux/Windows users: replace `CMD` with `CTRL`) opens an input field for command input, and using `CMD-SHIFT-2` you can call up a menu with predefined commands. The predefined commands can be edited from within Sublime Text using the `Piper: ... ` commands in the command palette (OS X: `CMD-SHIFT-P`).

The plugin will work under OS X and Linux, and might work under Windows (feedback welcome :).
